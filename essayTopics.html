					<li data-theme="b">How do women fit into the stories?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Women play a small role throughout the different stories, as many of them are set in Vietnam away from the woman back home, however the role they play is still significant.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Women for instance, provide hope for the men in Vietnam as they realize that outside the atrocities of the war zone their is a life for them with the women they love.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Pictures and letters from the women help the men fighting in Vietnam keep going with the belief that if they push through and survive they have something better waiting for them.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However often times the women that the men in the stories use to keep pushing themselves on end up hurting them in the end.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The hopes that kept them alive during the war fall through once back in the states as Jimmy Cross for example can never win the love of the woman he seems to be fighting for.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Another character, Mark Fossie, convinces his love to travel to Vietnam to keep him sane and alive, however not long after she leaves him and breaks his heart.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Women are very important to the soldiers fighting the war, however often they become nothing more than unrealistic players in the soldiers fantasies, and in the end they often never live up to what the soldiers hope for after the war.</li>
				</ul>

					<li data-theme="b">Why does O'Brien put so much emphasis in what the soldiers carried?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Throughout the novel the author spends much time discussing what the soldiers were carrying while in Vietnam.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">He often goes into detailed lists and descriptions of the things carried, even if they seemed like unimportant objects like candy or cigarettes.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">The reason he does this however seems more so to make the characters seem more human so that the reader can better relate and understand what they experienced during the war.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Also, he often would describe the weight of the items the men carried to better explain how difficult it would be for one to be a soldier during the war.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However O'Brien goes far beyond the physical objects that the men carry, as he describes the emotional burdens that weigh down the men during their fight.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Tim Lavender's death is a great example of the emotional burden of carrying things.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Tim has extreme anxiety causing him the need to carry drugs with him to keep him sane, however the drugs also keep his mind preoccupied which results in him getting shot.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Jimmy Cross believes he is responsible for this death as he believes his distraction by the emotional burden of his love for Martha has prevented him from saving Tim from death.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">O'Brien's use of the idea of carrying spans the whole collection of stories, as he often carries characters and objects from one story to another.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Carrying is a very important aspect of the novel, perhaps the most important as suggested by the title, as it allows the story to resonate on a personal level to all the readers.</li>
