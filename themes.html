					<li data-theme="d">War is a very challenging and trying time for a person not just physically but also emotionally</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Many of the characters featured are struggling to deal with a foreign land and a brutal war, all while rationalizing their emotions</li>
					<li data-theme="d">One common emotion that puts pressure on the men is love. They must try to hold on to their loved ones back home, whether it be their relatives or lovers, all while being separated by thousands of miles and without much communication</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Another emotion they must wrestle with is fear. As a soldier they face death often yet showing their fear also makes them more vulnerable to death, they must learn to control their fear</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The emotional burdens not only last during the war however</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Following the war many of the soldiers return home carrying the atrocities of war in their mind with them for the rest of their life</li>
					<li data-theme="d">They are haunted by the death of friends and the suffering they experienced and must learn to cope with what the war left them with</li>

				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The Fear of Shaming One's self</li>
					<li data-theme="d">One common theme represented is the soldiers fear of shaming themselves as a driving factor in their decisions in war</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Many of the stories featured show just how significant the fear of shaming ones self in front of peers can change a person</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Even before going to Vietnam, the fear of shame seems to drive many men to go to war</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Not stepping up and going to war as a young man during the Vietnam war could not only hurt ones reputation, but hurt the reputation of their family</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The pressure that this fear puts upon a young man also can effect them greatly and even put them at great dangers</li>
					<li data-theme="c">War is very difficult, and being put under a lot of stress can effect ones actions in war, making them more susceptible to death and also put others around them in danger</li>

					<li data-theme="b">The effect of truth, or lack of truth in storytelling</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The stories that O'Brien tells seem to lack authenticity at times, as many of the accounts seem to contradict themselves</li>
					<li data-theme="c">O'Brien mentions however before he even begins telling the stories, that they are fictional</li>
					<li data-theme="d">His fictional telling of events during the Vietnam war go on to show that perhaps truth is not important in this situation</li>
					<li data-theme="c">All the details do not have to be exact, as it is more important that the story is told, and less important whether there are complete truths being told</li>
					<li data-theme="d">O'Brien's writing is very effective and his stories help one better understand what life is like for a soldier, regardless of whether or not all of the events actually happened</li>
